# 📊 Analyzing Data with Pandas & Visualizing Results with Matplotlib
## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize data using Pandas and Matplotlib, with the Iris dataset as a case study.

The notebook walks through:
* Loading and exploring the dataset.
* Performing basic statistical analysis.
* Visualizing results using multiple chart types (line, bar, histogram, scatter).
* Extracting insights about different Iris flower species.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* scikit-learn

You can install them with:
- pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
* jupyter notebook

Run all cells to:
* Explore dataset structure.
* Generate summary statistics.
* Create visualizations.

## 📊 Tasks Completed
1. Load & Explore Dataset
* Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.
* Converted it into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Added a new species column.
* Checked for missing values (none found).

2. Basic Data Analysis
* Summary statistics for all features.
* Mean values grouped by species.
Example insights (e.g., Setosa has the smallest petals, Virginica the largest).

3. Data Visualization
* Line Chart: Sepal length trend across dataset order.
* Bar Chart: Average petal length per species.
* Histogram: Distribution of sepal width.
* Scatter Plot: Sepal length vs petal length colored by species.
Virginica tends to have the largest measurements overall.

Feature separation between species is most visible in petal measurements.
